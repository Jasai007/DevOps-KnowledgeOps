# 🚀 DevOps KnowledgeOps AI Assistant - Setup Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

Your AI assistant now has **conversation memory**! The agent will:
- Remember previous messages in the same session
- Maintain context across the conversation
- Reference earlier topics and questions
- Provide more coherent, contextual responses

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### Option 1: Manual Start (Recommended for Testing)

1. **Start the API Server:**
   ```powershell
   $env:AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
   $env:BEDROCK_AGENT_ID="MNJESZYALW"
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

2. **In a new terminal, start the Frontend:**
   ```powershell
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open your browser:** http://localhost:3000

### Option 2: Automated Start
```powershell
.\start-devops-ai.ps1
```

## 🧪 Test Conversation Memory

Run this test to verify memory is working:
```powershell
# In a new terminal (while API server is running)
node test-conversation-memory.js
```

## 💬 How to Test in the UI

1. **Start a conversation:** "I'm working on a Kubernetes cluster called 'production-cluster'"
2. **Ask a follow-up:** "What logs should I check for this cluster?"
3. **Verify:** The agent should remember "production-cluster" and provide contextual advice

## 🔧 Features Now Working

### ✅ Conversation Memory
- Each session maintains conversation history
- Agent remembers previous messages and context
- Follow-up questions work naturally

### ✅ Session Management
- Persistent sessions across page refreshes
- Session indicator in the UI
- Conversation history tracking

### ✅ Real Bedrock Integration
- Connected to your actual Bedrock Agent (MNJESZYALW)
- Real AI responses (no more mock data)
- Proper error handling and retries

### ✅ Enhanced Context
- Agent receives conversation history with each message
- Builds contextual prompts for better responses
- Maintains Bedrock's internal session state

## 🎯 What You'll See

### In the UI:
- "Session Active - Conversation Memory Enabled" indicator
- Natural conversation flow
- Agent references previous messages

### In the API Logs:
- Session creation and management
- Conversation history tracking
- Context building for each message

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If conversations still seem disconnected:
1. Check that you're using the same browser tab (session persists per tab)
2. Verify the API server shows session logs
3. Test with the memory test script

### If the agent doesn't start:
1. Verify your AWS credentials are configured
2. Check that the Bedrock Agent ID is correct
3. Ensure you have model access in us-east-1

## 📊 Monitoring

Watch the API server logs to see:
- Session creation: `🔄 Using session: session-xxx`
- History tracking: `📚 Conversation history length: X`
- Context usage: `💾 Session xxx now has X messages`

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your DevOps AI Assistant now has proper conversation memory and will provide much more coherent, contextual responses. The agent will remember your previous questions and build on the conversation naturally.

**Happy DevOps-ing! 🚀**
