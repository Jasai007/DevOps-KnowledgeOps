# New Session Fix Documentation

## Problem
The DevOps KnowledgeOps Agent was not responding properly in new chat sessions. After the initial session worked fine, new sessions would return incomplete or inappropriate responses.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing System Instructions**: New sessions weren't getting proper DevOps expert system instructions
2. **Cache Interference**: New sessions were potentially getting cached responses from previous sessions
3. **Context Issues**: The agent wasn't being properly initialized with its DevOps expertise role

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced System Instructions for New Sessions
Added comprehensive DevOps expert system instructions that are automatically included for new sessions:

```javascript
if (session.messages.length === 1) {
  systemInstructions = `You are a DevOps Expert AI Assistant with deep knowledge of:
- AWS services (EKS, ECS, Lambda, CloudFormation, CodePipeline, etc.)
- Container technologies (Docker, Kubernetes, Helm)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK)
- CI/CD pipelines and automation
- Monitoring and observability tools
- Security best practices
- Troubleshooting and problem-solving

Please provide helpful, accurate, and practical DevOps guidance. Use examples and code snippets when appropriate.

}
```

### 2. Cache Disabling for New Sessions
Modified the AgentCore Gateway to disable caching for new sessions to prevent inappropriate cached responses:

```javascript
const gatewayRequest = {
  message: finalMessage,
  sessionId: sessionId,
  userId: userId,
  priority: 'normal',
  context: {
    messageCount: session.messages.length,
    hasHistory: session.messages.length > 1,
    isNewSession: session.messages.length === 1,
    disableCache: session.messages.length === 1 // Disable cache for new sessions
  }
};
```

### 3. Improved Session ID Generation
Enhanced session ID generation to ensure uniqueness and prevent collisions:

```javascript
function getOrCreateSession(sessionId, userId = 'anonymous') {
  if (!sessionId) {
    // Generate a unique session ID with timestamp to avoid collisions
    sessionId = `session-${Date.now()}-${uuidv4()}`;
  }
  // ... rest of function
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Logging and Debugging
Added better logging to track session creation and message processing:

```javascript
console.log(`ðŸš€ Using AgentCore Gateway for enhanced processing (new session: ${session.messages.length === 1})`);
console.log(`ðŸš« Cache disabled for this request (new session: ${request.context?.isNewSession})`);
```

## Files Modified

1. **backend/server.js**
   - Enhanced system instructions for new sessions
   - Added cache disabling for new sessions
   - Improved session ID generation
   - Better logging and debugging

2. **backend/agentcore-gateway.js**
   - Added support for disableCache flag
   - Enhanced cache logic to respect new session requirements
   - Improved logging for cache decisions

## Testing

Created comprehensive test script: `tests/test-new-session-fix.js`

The test verifies:
- âœ… New sessions are created successfully
- âœ… First messages get proper system instructions (no cache)
- âœ… Follow-up messages include conversation history
- âœ… Sessions are properly isolated
- âœ… Cache is disabled for new sessions

## Usage

To test the fix:
```bash
# Start the server
node backend/server.js

# Run the test (in another terminal)
node tests/test-new-session-fix.js
```

## Expected Behavior

### New Session (First Message)
- Gets comprehensive DevOps expert system instructions
- Cache is disabled to ensure fresh response
- Agent responds with full DevOps expertise context

### Existing Session (Follow-up Messages)
- Includes conversation history for context
- Cache is enabled for performance
- Agent maintains conversation continuity

## Impact

This fix ensures that:
1. **New sessions work properly** - Users get expert DevOps responses from the first message
2. **Consistent expertise** - Every new conversation starts with proper DevOps context
3. **No cache interference** - New sessions get fresh, contextually appropriate responses
4. **Better user experience** - Eliminates the "broken new session" problem

## Monitoring

The fix includes enhanced logging to monitor:
- New session creation
- Cache hit/miss rates for new vs existing sessions
- System instruction application
- Session isolation verification
