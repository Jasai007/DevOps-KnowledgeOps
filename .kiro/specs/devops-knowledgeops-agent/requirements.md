# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DevOps KnowledgeOps Agent is a simplified, pure chat assistant powered by Amazon Bedrock AgentCore that provides expert-level DevOps guidance through conversational interactions. This agent focuses exclusively on knowledge sharing, advice, and troubleshooting guidance without executing any actions on infrastructure. The system emphasizes individual user memory, session persistence, and AgentCore's native capabilities to deliver personalized DevOps expertise through a clean local backend architecture.

## Glossary

- **AgentCore**: Amazon Bedrock's agent runtime that provides DevOps expertise and conversation management
- **User Session**: Individual conversation context maintained per user with memory persistence
- **Local Backend**: Node.js server running locally that interfaces with AgentCore
- **Memory Management**: System capability to remember user conversations and context across sessions

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to interact with an AgentCore-powered chat assistant through a simple interface, so that I can get immediate expert DevOps guidance without any infrastructure complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the Local Backend SHALL present a clean, responsive chat interface
2. WHEN a user types a DevOps-related question THEN the Local Backend SHALL process the query using AgentCore directly
3. WHEN AgentCore processes a query THEN the Local Backend SHALL return contextually relevant DevOps expertise and recommendations
4. WHEN a user sends multiple messages THEN the Local Backend SHALL maintain conversation context using AgentCore's native memory

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want the AgentCore to understand complex DevOps scenarios and remember my specific environment context, so that I can receive personalized guidance across multiple conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user describes their infrastructure setup THEN AgentCore SHALL analyze the context and store it in User Session memory
2. WHEN a user asks about specific DevOps tools THEN AgentCore SHALL provide expert-level guidance using its knowledge base
3. WHEN a user presents a troubleshooting scenario THEN AgentCore SHALL offer systematic debugging approaches and solutions
4. WHEN a user returns to continue a previous conversation THEN AgentCore SHALL recall the previous context from User Session memory

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want the AgentCore to provide personalized best practices based on my team's context and previous conversations, so that I can get consistent, tailored guidance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks about DevOps best practices THEN AgentCore SHALL provide industry-standard recommendations with rationale
2. WHEN a user inquires about implementation strategies THEN AgentCore SHALL offer step-by-step guidance tailored to their remembered context
3. WHEN a user asks about security considerations THEN AgentCore SHALL integrate DevSecOps principles into recommendations
4. WHEN a user seeks architecture advice THEN AgentCore SHALL suggest solutions based on previously discussed infrastructure and preferences

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps practitioner, I want the AgentCore to remember my skill level and learning progress, so that I can receive appropriately tailored guidance that builds on previous conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reports an incident or error THEN AgentCore SHALL provide systematic troubleshooting steps appropriate to their remembered skill level
2. WHEN a user asks for learning resources THEN AgentCore SHALL recommend resources based on their learning history and preferences
3. WHEN a user needs help with automation THEN AgentCore SHALL suggest tools consistent with their previously discussed technology stack
4. WHEN a user asks about monitoring THEN AgentCore SHALL provide guidance that builds on their existing monitoring setup from Memory Management

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Local Backend to provide fast AgentCore responses with session continuity, so that I can quickly get help during critical situations without losing conversation context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a query THEN the Local Backend SHALL return AgentCore responses within 5 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN AgentCore provides recommendations THEN the Local Backend SHALL include confidence indicators and source references where applicable
3. WHEN a user asks follow-up questions THEN AgentCore SHALL maintain context using User Session memory and build upon previous responses
4. IF AgentCore cannot provide a definitive answer THEN the Local Backend SHALL clearly communicate limitations and suggest alternative resources

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps team member, I want a simple chat interface that remembers my preferences and communication style, so that the experience becomes more personalized over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user accesses the Local Backend THEN the interface SHALL be intuitive and require no training
2. WHEN a user interacts with the chat THEN AgentCore SHALL provide clear, well-formatted responses adapted to their remembered communication preferences
3. WHEN a user needs help THEN AgentCore SHALL provide contextual guidance based on their previous questions and skill level
4. WHEN responses include code or configurations THEN the Local Backend SHALL format them clearly with proper syntax highlighting

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer working with cloud infrastructure, I want AgentCore to remember my specific cloud environment and provide consistent advice across sessions, so that I don't have to re-explain my setup repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user mentions their cloud platform THEN AgentCore SHALL store this in User Session memory and provide platform-specific guidance
2. WHEN a user asks about cloud migration THEN AgentCore SHALL offer strategies based on their remembered current infrastructure
3. WHEN a user inquires about multi-cloud scenarios THEN AgentCore SHALL provide advice consistent with their previously discussed architecture
4. WHEN a user asks about hybrid cloud setups THEN AgentCore SHALL reference their stored infrastructure context from Memory Management
